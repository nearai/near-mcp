# NEAR MCP

This project is an [MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol) compatible server for interacting with the [NEAR blockchain](https://near.org/). This tool provides a way for LLMs and AI agents to securely access and interact with NEAR accounts and blockchain functionality.

## Installing

The main way `near-mcp` is mean to be used is with an MCP compadible service.

Adding to the [`claude` code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) cli:

```bash
claude mcp add near-mcp npx @nearai/near-mcp@latest run
```

Adding via JSON config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "near-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nearai/near-mcp@latest", "run"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Adding to [`goose`](https://block.github.io/goose/)

```

└  Added near-mcp extension
```

Or you can install it globally and use it directly.

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @nearai/near-mcp@latest

# Or use directly with npx
npx @nearai/near-mcp@latest run
```

## Available Tools

see [TOOLS.md](./TOOLS.md) for a list of available tools and arguments.

## Integration with AI Models

This tool is designed to be used with AI models that support the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol). It enables AI assistants to:

1. Manage NEAR accounts on behalf of users
2. Check account balances and status
3. Sign and send transactions
4. Create new accounts and manage access keys

## Security Considerations

- This MCP is meant to be run locally. Account private keys are stored in a local unencrypted keystore where the MCP server is running.
- The underlying models should not have access to see the private keys of the accounts they are interacting with with _one exception_. The `import_account` tool allows the model to import an account from a private key. This requires the user to provide the private key to the model.
